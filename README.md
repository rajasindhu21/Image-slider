# Image-slider
I have created an automatic image slider using HTML. The slider transitions between images every few seconds without any user interaction, providing a smooth and dynamic visual experience. It's ideal for showcasing multiple images or features in a compact space.
The image slider enhances the user interface by automatically displaying images in a loop. It creates an engaging and interactive feel for the website while saving space. The transition effects between slides make the presentation more visually appealing. This feature is particularly useful for photo galleries, product showcases, or banners on landing pages. By using HTML along with CSS animations or JavaScript, the slider operates smoothly and efficiently without requiring user input.
